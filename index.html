    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I love people and good food. I love sharing good moments with close friends but I love meeting new people on my daily journey. I love design and I love programming. Right now I would like to focus more on the programming part. My goal is to create and maintain responsive websites and applications through the combination of HTML5 , CSS3 and the fascinating JavaScript dealing with their behaviour across browsers and devices.</p>
